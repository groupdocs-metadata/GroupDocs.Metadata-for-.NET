## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

{{< alert style="info" >}}This section lists public API changes that were introduced in GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET 18.7. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behaviour behind the scenes in GroupDocs.Metadata which may affect existing code. Any behaviour introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behaviour is especially important and is documented here.{{< /alert >}}

### Implement the ability to update IPTC metadata in a PSD file 

##### Description

This enhancement allows a user to remove and update IPTC metadata in PSD files

##### Public API changes

The *IIptc* interface has been implemented in the *PsdFormat* class  
The *UpdateIptc(IptcCollection)* method has been added to the *PsdFormat* class  
The *UpdateIptc(IptcDataSet)* method has been added to the *PsdFormat* class  
The *RemoveIptc* method has been added to the *PsdFormat* class

##### Usecases

Update IPTC metadata.

**C#**

```csharp
using (PsdFormat format = new PsdFormat(@"D:\input.psd"))
{
    IptcCollection iptc = format.GetIptc();
    if (iptc == null)
    {
        iptc = new IptcCollection();
    }
    iptc.Add(new IptcProperty(2, "urgency", 10, 5));
    format.UpdateIptc(iptc);
    format.Save(@"D:\output.psd");
}
```

Remove IPTC metadata.

**C#**

```csharp
using (PsdFormat format = new PsdFormat(@"D:\input.psd"))
{
    format.RemoveIptc();
    format.Save(@"D:\output.psd");
}
```

### Reduce memory consumption of the PSD format

##### Description

This enhancement allows working with PSD files with less memory consumption.

##### Public API changes

None.

##### Usecases

Please note that the *PsdFormat* class implements the *IDisposable* interface and it's necessary to call the *Dispose()* method when you're done working with its instance.

**C#**

```csharp
using (PsdFormat format = new PsdFormat(@"d:\input.psd"))
{
    // Working with metadata
}
```

If you are loading a PSD file from a stream, it's up to you to close the stream when the file is not needed anymore.

**C#**

```csharp
using (Stream stream = File.Open(@"d:\input.psd", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite))
{
    using (PsdFormat format = new PsdFormat(stream))
    {
        // Working with metadata
    }
    // The stream is still open here
}
```

The same rule works if you are saving the output file into a stream.

**C#**

```csharp
using (Stream stream = File.Open(@"d:\output.psd", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite))
{
    using (PsdFormat format = new PsdFormat(@"d:\input.psd"))
    {
        // Working with metadata

        format.Save(stream);
    }
    // The stream is still open here
}
```

### Reduce memory consumption of the Mp3 format

##### Description

This enhancement allows working with mp3 files with less memory consumption.

##### Public API changes

None.

##### Usecases

Please note that the *Mp3Format* class implements the *IDisposable* interface and it's necessary to call the *Dispose()* method when you're done working with its instance.

**C#**

```csharp
using (Mp3Format format = new Mp3Format(@"d:\input.mp3"))
{
    // Working with metadata
}
```

If you are loading an mp3 file from a stream, it's up to you to close the stream when the file is not needed anymore.

**C#**

```csharp
using (Stream stream = File.Open(@"d:\input.mp3", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite))
{
    using (Mp3Format format = new Mp3Format(stream))
    {
        // Working with metadata
    }
    // The stream is still open here
}
```

The same rule works if you are saving the output file into a stream.

**C#**

```csharp
using (Stream stream = File.Open(@"d:\output.mp3", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite))
{
    using (Mp3Format format = new Mp3Format(@"d:\input.mp3"))
    {
        // Working with metadata

        format.Save(stream);
    }
    // The stream is still open here
}
```
